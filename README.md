# CryoChat
A simple messaging system built in python.

Installation Guide:

EASY SETUP:
1. Extract the CryoChat.zip
2. Make sure the bin folder is in teh same directory as the .exe
3. run CryoChat.exe

SLIGHTLY HARDER SETUP:
1. Extract the CryoChatSourceCode.zip
2. Make sure the bin folder is in teh same directory as the .pyw
3. Make sure Python 3.5 or newer is installed.
4. Install all the needed modules (use the base_library.zip for help)
5. Run CryoChat.pyw


I AM STILL GETTING ERRORS:
1. Go back and check the SETUP steps
2. For .exe users try the slightly harder installation method, and run teh python file.
3. For source code users try using pycryptodome instead of pycryptodomex or vice versa
4. Google the problem and find a Stack Overflow page. :)
5. I'm so sorry it doesn't work, try leaving a comment and I will do my best to help.

This project was mostly a learning experience. It is far from a finished product, so to anyone going through the code. I'm sorry.
